            <h2>Article 1</h2>
            <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
                expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
                is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
                great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to
                find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
