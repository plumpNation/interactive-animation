Before you can run, you need to walk. This is where I'm going to learn from other's ideas and
inspirations, and try to reverse engineer other people's work and to learn how they achieve
excellence.

## About this site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by someone else and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). It uses Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

## Why does it exist?

I hope to use it as a playground full of interesting interactivity examples that showcase simple,
framework-less html5 interactions that can be used to create useful experiences across devices.

I'm hoping to cover animation, interaction and accessibility.

I believe the future is web, whether we like it or not. Javascript, HTML and CSS are my main tools
of trade and they didn't used to be. I learned them. I accept them. I now even champion them.

While I respect those that do native development, even am jealous because of the tooling and
performance, I am committed to promote the use of HTML5(6,7,8...) on all platforms.

## What are the golden rules?

### MINIMUM LIBRARIES! AS FAR AS POSSIBLE!

Try as hard as possible to not include any other bootstrap libraries than those already loaded
in this website template. That basically gives me
 - Bootstrap
 - jQuery

I will never be including Angular, jQuery UI, jQuery mobile or any other framework or library.
My full support goes to those scripters that code vanilla, or provide bootstrap or jQuery flavours.
I would prefer not to have to libraries loaded, but I did not design this site, not should I
complain.

I imagine I will probably include [d3](http://d3js.org/) in this list...

### READ THE SOURCE! AS FAR AS POSSIBLE!

No code should be included without trying to understand at least the business logic in the source.
I will not promise to read and understand the maths in graphics libraries and, in return, I will not
ask any math genius to figure out the complexity that is, the woman.

### DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL! AS FAR AS POSSIBLE!

I will be trying to move fast, get something out and improve it later if it needs it. I will be
using other peoples code as much as possible, and crediting them as the creators.

## Open source

Do it. Contribute. I will only use modules/scripts/code that is on the WTFPL, Apache 2 or MIT
license. This list may grow as I come to understand the licenses better.

## Github

Use github. It rocks. Use an MIT license. It also rocks. Give it away. Just say yes.
