Before you can run, you need to walk. This is where I'm going to learn from other's ideas and
inspirations, and try to reverse engineer other people's work and to learn how they achieve
excellence.

## Github

Use github. It rocks.

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by someone else and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). It uses Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Whatever Trevor, this is hopefully going to turn into a reasonable interesting collection of
interactivity examples.

I'm hoping to cover animation, interaction and accessibility, but if it's anything like all other
things, I'll probably just let the project rot.
