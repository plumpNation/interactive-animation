I am a web focused developer mostly working using Microsoft .Net technologies. Occasionally, I end up working on non web related projects. I am based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and work for C4 Advanced Solution as Application Developer.
This is my personal website and blog where I put down my thoughts, solutions to problems and learning notes.

## Github

Use github. It rocks.


## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by someone else and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). It uses Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Whatever Trevor, this is hopefully going to turn into a reasonable interesting collection of
interactivity examples.

I'm hoping to cover animation, interaction and accessibility, but if it's anything like all other
things, I'll probably just let the project rot.
