# Interactive animation

This repository is a place for me to try to build a collection of interactive animations in order to build knowledge of the existing solutions, tool chains and players.

## Thanks to...

Thanks first of all to the creators of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the [JekyllMetro theme](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro).

Also, I have had a lot of inspiration from the [3dtransforms](http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/) github site, although it concentrates on the
CSS and not the interaction.

## Open source all the way

Although I plan to only use open source libraries, I am starting out with the
[Greensock](http://greensock.com/) library, which is free for all intents and purposes when doing
a project like this. However, if anyone was to try and reuse any of the techniques here in a
commercial work that requires licenses or renewal fees, or charges people to access, then Greensock
requires a commercial license, which is fine, it's just not what I'm trying to achieve here.
