# Interactive animation

## Thanks to the projects I'm using.
Thanks first of all to the creators of Jekyll and this [theme](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro).

This repository is a place for me to try to build a collection of interactive animations in order to build knowledge of the existing solutions, tool chains and players.

Although I plan to only use open source libraries, I am starting out with the Greensock library, which is free for all intents and purposes when doing a project like this. However, if anyone was to try and reuse any of the techniques here in a commercial work that requires licenses or renewal fees, or charges people to access, then Greensock requires a commercial license, which is fine, it's just not what I'm trying to achieve here.
